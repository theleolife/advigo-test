# Trade-offs 

 - My mackbook's screen got broken after a botle of water felt down on my desk table :/
 - Find a time to complete the task, as I am moving between others coding challenge.
 - Try to include some typescript react as inferface and dealing with eslint erros.
 - the node api was made by node and using faker, but the fakers.js package version wasn't not realy working correct.
 - In process* writing test for api call checking if the loading is correct, tracking if the event onClick and onChage button /select is being changed correcly. 
 - Missing, stars as icon for each note review. It would have a better look.
 - Missing, filter for review. It was added only sort of review byt best and worst.
